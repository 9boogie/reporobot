# Notes

Because too many months between visits to the server and I always have to look it up.

```bash
# restart the server
mg restart reporobot
# tail them logs
tail -f logs/reporobot
# active repo is in checkouts/reporobot, remote is named github
cd checkouts/reporobot
git pull github master
```
